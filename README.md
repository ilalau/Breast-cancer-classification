# Breast-cancer-classification-using-NN-and-PSO
System for Breast cancer classification using Neural Networks and Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO)


To run the code you need to have MATLAB installed on your pc.

In the data.mat you can find the values from researchers about breast cancer. 

In the NN.m file you can find the implementation of the Neural Network for classify the samples according to the values given during the lectures.
It's quite easy to understand what is done reading the comments to the code.

In the PSO_NN folder you can find file, we applied the PSO to the Neural Network.

In the pdf file there's an accurate explication about theory and about how the code works and how it has been built.
